# TokenWise for CodeBuddy Code

A CodeBuddy plugin with one `PreToolUse` hook on the `Bash` tool. For a
command that a TokenWise filter may recognize (test runners, compilers,
`git status/diff`, `grep`/`rg`, `find`, `ls`, build tools, …) the hook
rewrites

```
python3 -m pytest -v
```

to

```
tokenwise run --host codebuddy --session <id> --call <id> -c 'python3 -m pytest --color=no -v'
```

`tokenwise run` executes the script with your shell, keeps the exit code and
signals, saves the original output under `~/.tokenwise`, and prints a
smaller projection when one is admitted. Every other command is left alone.

Verified against CodeBuddy Code 2.175.0 in real `codebuddy -p` sessions:

- A failing `pytest -v` run (150 passed, 1 failed): the model read 1,245
  bytes instead of 13,328, and still named the failing test and its
  assertion. Its history keeps the original command.
- The hook returns no permission decision: an `allow` would skip
  CodeBuddy's permission check entirely, deny rules included. CodeBuddy
  checks the command as the model wrote it, so your rules keep working: with
  `--allowedTools "Bash(python3 -m pytest:*)"` the wrapped run went ahead,
  and with `--disallowedTools "Bash(python3 -m pytest:*)"` it was blocked.
- CodeBuddy's `PostToolUse` event carries the exit code but not the
  command's output, so results cannot be replaced after the fact; wrapping
  is the only route.
- Background commands (`run_in_background`) are not wrapped: `tokenwise run`
  would hold their output back until they end.
- `tokenwise` must be on the `PATH` CodeBuddy runs hooks with
  (`npm install -g @tokenwise/cli`, then `tokenwise doctor`).

## Compaction (full, through a mod)

`hooks/compaction.js` is a CodeBuddy mod (an in-process module the plugin's
`hooks.json` lists under `modules`). Verified on 2.175.0:

- `session.compact` sees the span CodeBuddy is about to summarize and adds
  one paragraph to the summarizer's instructions;
- `session.append` sees the summary row as it is stored and rewrites its
  summary into the checkpoint: CodeBuddy's summary, your messages word for
  word, and the catalog of the tool results TokenWise kept (`tokenwise shadow
  checkpoint`). Both shapes CodeBuddy stores are handled: `/compact` (an
  assistant row) and automatic compaction when the context would overflow
  (a user row);
- `tokenwise_recall`, registered as a mod tool, reads any of them again
  (`tokenwise recall`); `tool.check` lets it run without a prompt.

A mod cannot import anything, so the work is done by `tokenwise`; on any failure
CodeBuddy's own summary stays. (CodeBuddy 2.175 ignores messages a
`session.compact` hook hands back, which is why the stored row is rewritten.)

## Learning

`/tokenwise:learn` starts a learning run in the background with this agent as
the learner (`tokenwise learn --learner codebuddy`); `/tokenwise:learn status`
and `/tokenwise:learn cancel` follow and stop it, and `/tokenwise:rules` lists
the learned filters (`off`, `on`, `rollback`). At startup the plugin says when
recorded output is worth learning from and when a run has finished.

## Install

From a checkout of this repository (it doubles as a CodeBuddy marketplace;
CodeBuddy reads `.codebuddy-plugin/` before `.claude-plugin/`):

```sh
codebuddy plugin marketplace add /path/to/tokenwise
codebuddy plugin install tokenwise@tokenwise
```

To try it in one session only:
`codebuddy --plugin-dir /path/to/tokenwise/adapters/codebuddy`.
Check savings with `tokenwise report --host codebuddy`. Turn it off with
`codebuddy plugin disable tokenwise@tokenwise`, or for one run with
`TOKENWISE_DISABLE=1`.
